This file folder will house all of the files needed to launch our python script as a Flask application

You should be able to launch the application using the weather.py file.
This will launch the file on your local network using address 0.0.0.0 on port 5000
To view the app and ensure it's working, execute the weather.py file and then open up your browser and type in http://0.0.0.0:5000

In order to get access this page from outside of your local network, you'll have to configure your network 
and forward external port 80 (your HTTP port) to internal port 5000 (your local Flask development server). 
This will direct all external traffic accessing your IP address to the port hosting your Flask server.

(Close the weather.py script if you haven't already)

This will be different for each router, but in general will require that you:
1. Log into your router (http://192.168.1.1)
2. Navigate to the port forwarding menu (might be located under advanced options)
3. Input the local IP of your raspberry pi (this can be determined by typing the ifconfig command into the terminal)
4. Indicate that the external port should be 80 and that it should interact with the internal port 5000. 
5. Save your settings and logout.
6. Navigate to whatismyip.com and jot down your public IP address

Execute the weather.py file

Now when you type in your public IP it should launch your weather application.
