# Python-Project
Repository for CSIT216 Python Raspberry Pi project

# Project Description
Using the python programming language, build and design a weather sensor network through the Raspberry Pi.
The python program will have visualization capabilities that can interface with the web along with other features.
The underlying framework for this project will be modeled on a previously established affective computing fuzzy system (Vincent, Braman, Trajkovski, 2008).

# Process:
Step 1 - Complete initial set up Raspberry Pi.<br/>
Step 2 - Install weather sensor and ensure data integrity.<br/>
Step 3 - Write Python script to output data to text file.<br/>
Step 4 - Implement cronjob to schedule daily automation and output of weather data.<br/>
Step 5 - Upload data to web server.<br/>
Step 6 - Set up web page to display data.<br/>
Step 7 - Develop affective computing/fuzzy logic to dynamically change webpage depending on data.<br/>
Step 8 - Incorporate affective computing/fuzzy logic into system.<br/>
