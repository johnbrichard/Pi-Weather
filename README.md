# Python-Project
Repository for CSIT216 Python Raspberry Pi project

# Project Description
Using the python programming language, build and design a weather sensor network through the Raspberry Pi.
The python program will have visualization capabilities that can interface with the web along with other features.
The underlying framework for this project will be modeled on a previously established affective computing fuzzy system (Vincent, Braman, Trajkovski, 2008).

# Process:
Step 1 - Complete initial set up Raspberry Pi.<br/>
Step 2 - Install weather sensor and ensure data integrity.<br/>
Step 3 - Write Python script to add data to Google Sheets file.<br/>
Step 4 - Implement crontab to schedule data automation.<br/>
Step 5 - Set up Flask web application to pull and display Sheets data.<br/>
Step 6 - Develop neural network to implement affective computing/fuzzy logic to webpage.<br/>
Step 7 - Incorporate affective computing/fuzzy logic into system.<br/>
